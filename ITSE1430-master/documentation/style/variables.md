# Variables

Use local variables to capture data needed within a method.

- Variables should use camel casing.
- Variables represent data and should be nouns.
- Variables should be descriptive (avoid single letter variables).
- AVOID using the same variable for different purposes.
- AVOID scoping a variable higher than it needs to be.
